# DriverPass Project

## Project Summary

The DriverPass project is designed to address a critical gap in driver education by providing supplementary testing resources and practical driving experience to help individuals successfully pass their DMV driving exams. This repository contains essential information and documentation related to the project.

## Client

**Client**: DriverPass

## System Overview

DriverPass aims to implement a comprehensive system that offers the following key features:

- Online courses and practice examinations.
- Real-world driving experiences for enrolled students.
- Appointment scheduling for students.
- Three distinct packages for students to choose from.
- Notifications for appointment creation, modification, and cancellation.
- Access to data for the owner from any computer or mobile device.

## Documentation

This repository includes key documents and information related to the DriverPass project:

- [Business Requirements Document]([link-to-document](https://github.com/Jgonzales0688/DriverPass/blob/main/CS%20255%20Business%20Requirements%20Document_DriverPass.docx)) - Detailed information on business goals, objectives, and technical requirements.
- [System Design]([link-to-document](https://github.com/Jgonzales0688/DriverPass/blob/main/CS%20255%20System%20Design%20Document%20Template.docx )) - Information on system components, purpose, and goals.

## What Was Done Well

One notable achievement in this project is the clear and detailed specification of both nonfunctional and functional requirements. This ensures that the project is well-defined and structured, providing a solid foundation for development.

## Area for Improvement

While the documentation is comprehensive, one area that could be further improved is the section on adaptability. It could be more explicit about how the system will handle potential browser updates and ensure long-term compatibility.

## User-Centered Approach

The project places a strong emphasis on interpreting and addressing user needs, recognizing their importance for the project's success. This user-centered approach ensures that the system will be user-friendly and effective.

## Software Design Approach

The software design approach for this project follows an incremental development process. It begins with the implementation of basic functionality and progressively adds features in subsequent iterations. To continually enhance the system, a user-centered approach, gathering user feedback, and conducting usability testing will be essential.

## Future Techniques

To ensure the success and longevity of the system, future techniques include:

- Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum or Kanban) for iterative development.
- Regular user feedback collection and usability testing.
- Monitoring emerging technologies and best practices to keep the system up-to-date and adaptable.
